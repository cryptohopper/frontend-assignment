# Cryptohopper Front-End Assignment

Congrats! You've made it to the assignment! ðŸ¥³

To get insights in your technical skills and how that matches the tech stack we use, we've setup a little assignment. There's a design file zip in the files above (in this git-repo) called design.zip. We'd like you to turn this design into a React app. Before you begin, please make sure you've read the [notes](#notes).

## How does it work?

1. Clone this repository
2. Do your magic ðŸª„
3. Push the changes to your repository
4. Share the link to your repository
5. You show/explain us what you have done next time we meet

## Stack Requirements

- [ ] NextJS _or_ plain React (NextJS preferred)
- [ ] TypeScript

## Things to take into consideration

- [ ] Reusability of components
- [ ] Code style
- [ ] Responsive design
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Performance / re-renders
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Accessibility

## Design

You can find the design in this repo calles design.zip. The design is a figma file. You can open it with the Figma desktop app for [Mac](https://www.figma.com/download/desktop/mac) or [Windows](https://www.figma.com/download/desktop/win), or check the [Figma downloads page](https://www.figma.com/downloads).

## Notes

- Don't focus on the bottom two footer blocks ("start trading with cryptohopper" and the actual footer). Only implement these when you have time left or really want to show what you can do.
- The comparison tool below the prices block does not need to function. This design does not explain what it does, so it is fine to just create a static version.
- This assignment has no time constraint, but try to **spend a maximum of 8 hours**. This does not mean you need to spend 8 hours on it.
- Don't feel pressured to implement everything mentioned above, it is just to help you get started, what is more important is how you do it.
- For styling, please choose the approach of your liking.

## Last but not least

**Have fun while doing the assignment**, we're eagerly to witness your awesome frontend skills!
